The **Decision Trees and Random Forest Project** focuses on predicting customer behavior using classification algorithms. It begins with data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis to understand feature relationships and patterns. The project then builds both **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models to classify outcomes and compares their performances. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports are used to assess model effectiveness. The Random Forest model generally provides higher accuracy and robustness by reducing overfitting. Feature importance visualization highlights the most influential factors. Overall, the project demonstrates practical machine learning for predictive decision-making.
